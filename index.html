    <p>
        My name is JOSEPH MUTYABA.<br /> I'm a Ugandan, male and  a resident in Kampala the capital of Uganda. <br/>
        The earliest years of my life were spent in a Village in Lwengo district called <em>Kabulasokke.</em>
        While there, i was groomed and raised up as a strong and cradle Catholic, with strict adherence to the <br/>
        teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ.
        <br /><br />
        It was in this very place that I received the three reat sacramnts of Baptism, Penance and my first <br/> 
        "Holy Communion."
        <br />After this, at the age of ten, I mum took me to stay with her in Kampala. <br/>
        In total I spent 9 years in Lwengo and the rest in different parts of Kampala. 
        <br />

            <b>Academic history</b>
        </a> 
    </h2>
    <p>
        I started my studies at a rural school called "Namunye Bright Academy", then I transferred to 
        "St. Mary's Primary School", then to "Good Shepherd Primary School". From there I transferred to
        "Trinity Children's centre" and finally to "Rock Foundation Primary School" from where I sat for my 
        <b> Primary Leaving Examinations </b> in the  year 2014.
        <br /><br />
        I joined <b>Kyambogo College High School</b> which for six years I fully attended. During
        the fourth <br/>
        year of my college life that is 2018, I sat for my <b>"Uganda Certificate of Education"</b> examinations.
        <br />
        In 2021, I sat for my <b>"Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education"</b> examinations in the same college.
        <br /><br />
        I was admitted on National merit to attend <b>Makerere University</b>, the greatest and mightiest<br/>
        higher learning institution in the country. At the time of writing this document, I was persuing <br/>
        a Bachelor of Science Degree in Software Engineering in the aforementioned University and in year one.
        <br /><br />
        All these achievements are the result of the infalible communion between a creature and its <b>Creator</b> <br/>
        in which case the creature is I myself Joseph Kevin Mutyaba and the "Creator" is the "The Lord<br/>
        God" who is the "Almighty and Eternity"
