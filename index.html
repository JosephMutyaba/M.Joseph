        My name is JOSEPH MUTYABA.<br /> I'm a Ugandan, male and  a resident in Kampala the capital of Uganda.
        The earliest years of my life were spent in a Village in Lwengo district called Kabulasokke.
        While there, i was roomed and raised up as a stron and cradle Catholic, with strict adherence to the teachin of our Lord Jesus Christ.
        <br /><br />
        It was in this very place that I received the three reat sacramnts of Baptism, Penance and my first 
        "Holy Communion."
        <br />After this, at the age of ten, I was brought by mum to come and stay in Kampala. 
        In total Ispent 9 years in Lwengo and the rest in different parts of Kampala. 
        <br />

    <p>
        I started my studies at a rural school called "Namunye Bright Academy", then I transferred to 
        "St. Mary's Primary School", then to "Good Shepherd Primary School". From there I transferred to
        "Trinity Children's centre" and finally to "Rock Foundation Primary School" from where I sat for my 
        "Primary Leaving Examinations" in the  year 2014.
        <br /><br />
        I joined <b>Kyambogo College High School</b> which for six years I fully attended. During
        the fourth year of my college life that is 2018, I sat for my "Uganda Certificate of Education" examinations.
        <br />
        In 2021, I sat for my "Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education" examinations in the same college.
        <br /><br />

        All these achievements are the result of the infalible communion between a creature and its <b>Creator</b>
        in which case the creature is I myself Joseph Kevin Mutyaba and the "Creator" is the "The Lord
